# Project Trilex: The Vector Resonance Engine

### ⚠️ Status: Experimental / Proof-of-Concept

## 1. The Problem: The Binary Bottleneck
Modern AI (LLMs) is constrained by the Von Neumann architecture. To process semantic meaning (high-dimensional vectors), current hardware forces data through a "binary funnel" of linear arithmetic (Matrix Multiplication). This results in massive energy waste (Heat) and latency.

We simulate 3D reality on 1D silicon. This is inefficient.

## 2. The Solution: Geometric Resonance (Trilex Architecture)
**Project Trilex** proposes a compute paradigm shift from **Arithmetic** to **Geometry**.
Instead of calculating `Activation = Σ(Weights * Inputs)`, we utilize a physical or simulated **Resonance Gate**.

### The Core Logic: `SYNC(A, B, C)`
A signal passes only if three vectors geometrically align in phase space:
1.  **Vector A (Input):** The Data.
2.  **Vector B (Memory/Filter):** The Pattern.
3.  **Vector C (Context):** The Intent/Phase.

If vectors align → **Resonance** (Signal propagates).
If vectors clash → **Damping** (Signal stops, 0 energy cost).

## 3. Repository Structure

* `/Emulator`: Python prototyping of the Trilex Logic Gate (replacing Standard Neurons with Resonance Neurons).
* `/Theory`: The "Simureality" Framework. Derivation of the physical principles (FCC Lattice constraints) that underpin this architecture.
* `/Blueprints`: Concepts for hardware implementation (Optical Interferometry, Spintronics, CISS-effect gates).

## 4. Goals
1.  Prove that Vector-Resonance Logic reduces computational complexity ($\Sigma K \to \min$) for associative tasks.
2.  Develop a hardware blueprint for a non-binary **Optical/Spintronic Processing Unit (OPU)**.
