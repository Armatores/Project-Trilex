## 1. The Problem: The Binary Bottleneck
Modern AI (LLMs) is constrained by the Von Neumann architecture. To process semantic meaning (high-dimensional vectors), current hardware forces data through a "binary funnel" of linear arithmetic (Matrix Multiplication). This results in massive energy waste (Heat), latency, and "hallucinations" due to probabilistic prediction.

We simulate 3D reality on 1D silicon. This is inefficient.

## 2. The Solution: Spectral Arithmetic (Prime Factorization)
**Project Trilex** proposes a compute paradigm shift from **Boolean Logic** to **Topological Number Theory**.

We utilize the **Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic** to encode geometry:
* **Dimensions as Primes:** Axis X=2, Axis Y=3, Axis Z=5...
* **Objects as Integers:** A vector `(3, 2, 1)` becomes the signature $2^3 \cdot 3^2 \cdot 5^1 = 360$.

### The Core Logic: `SYNC(A, B, C)`
Instead of calculating `if (A == B)`, we utilize a physical **Resonance Gate** (GCD - Greatest Common Divisor).
Signals interact ONLY if they share a geometric factor.

* **Movement is Multiplication:** Moving an object is multiplying its signature.
* **Interaction is Resonance:** Collision occurs if `GCD(Sig_A, Sig_B) > 1`.
* **Logic is Interference:** `TRUE` is constructive resonance, `FALSE` is darkness.

This enables **Hardware-Verified AI**: The system physically cannot process a logical paradox (fractional result), eliminating hallucinations at the hardware level.

## 3. Repository Structure

### `/Emulator` (Python MVP)
Software prototyping of the Trilex Logic.
* `vector_mind.py`: Semantic Processor. Demonstrates `King / Man * Woman = Queen` logic using prime number arithmetic.
* `trilex_collider.py`: Physics Engine. Simulates gravity and clustering via GCD interactions (no force formulas).
* `trilex_alu.py`: Arithmetic Logic Unit. Implements physical movement via multiplication.

### `/Theory` (Simureality Framework)
* **The Simureality Doctrine:** Derivation of the physical principles (FCC Lattice constraints) that underpin this architecture.
* **Appendixes:** Mathematical proofs connecting Prime Numbers, Geometry, and Physics.

### `/Blueprints` (Hardware Spec)
Concepts for hardware implementation:
* **OPFC (Optical Prime Factorization Core):** Design for a Ring Resonator chip where frequencies correspond to prime numbers.
* **CISS-effect Gates:** Spintronic implementation of the "Identity Channel".


## 4. Goals
1.  **Prove** that Vector-Resonance Logic reduces computational complexity ($\Sigma K \to \min$) for associative tasks (Search, AI).
2.  **Develop** a hardware blueprint for a non-binary **Optical/Spintronic Processing Unit (OPU)**.
3.  **Build** a semantic search engine operating in $O(1)$ time complexity using Prime Factorization.
