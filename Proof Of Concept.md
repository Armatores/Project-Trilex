# PROOF_OF_CONCEPT: Vector Resonance Visualization

### 🚀 The Smoke Test
This document provides the visual proof that the core logic of the **Trilex OPU (Optical Processing Unit)** is sound. The Trizistor is designed to execute **Geometric Consensus Logic**, where the result of the computation is determined by the physical alignment of light vectors, not arithmetic processing.

## TEST 1: CHAOS (The Anti-Hallucination Filter)

* **Objective:** Show what happens when data (Input A), memory (Memory B), and context (Context C) are mismatched.
* **Result:** **Resonance Score: 0.0483.** The Trizistor Gate remains closed.
* **Interpretation:** The physical interference pattern (analogous to the non-linear chamber in the OPU) instantly filters the signal. The system remains silent, consuming **zero energy** on irrelevant or noisy data. This is the hardware-level solution to the modern AI 'hallucination' problem.

## TEST 2: SYNC (The Flash of Insight)

* **Objective:** Show the result when all three components align perfectly.
* **Result:** **Resonance Score: 1.0000.** The Trizistor Gate opens.
* **Interpretation:** Perfect Geometric Alignment causes a **Constructive Interference** (the "Flash of Insight"). In the OPU, this would generate the exponential energy required for the logical '1'. The computation is instant, pure, and verifiable. The convergence of the three vectors (Input, Memory, Context) is the **Truth**.

### Conclusion
The **Trilex Logic** provides a pathway to **deterministic, zero-noise, and zero-heat computing** by replacing expensive arithmetic with native physical synchronization. The visual data confirms the validity of the **Geometric Consensus** axiom.

*Project Trilex is ready for hardware prototyping.*
