# The Axioms of Simureality

### 📐 The Theoretical Foundation of Project Trilex

This directory contains the core scientific and philosophical texts that underpin the Vector-Resonance architecture. We postulate that the Universe itself is a computational system optimizing for complexity ($\Sigma K \to \min$), and our goal is to reverse-engineer its hardware principles.

## 1. The Physics: "Grid Physics" (Pre-print)
**File:** `Grid Physics.pdf`
* **Status:** Submitted to IPI Letters.
* **Content:** A rigorous mathematical derivation of fundamental constants.
* **Key Discovery:** **The Node Square Law ($M \propto N^2$)**. Mass is not a parameter; it is the computational cost of updating active nodes on a Face-Centered Cubic (FCC) lattice.
* **Relevance to AI:** This paper proves that efficiency comes from specific geometric packing (Resonance), not brute force.

## 2. The Ontology: "Genesis"
**File:** `Genesis.md`
* **Status:** Philosophical Framework / "The Boot Log".
* **Content:** A chronological reconstruction of the evolution of complexity on Earth—from the "Steam Crisis" of the Hadean eon to the emergence of biological agents.
* **Key Concept:** **The Symbiosis Theorem**. Intelligence evolves to "overclock" the system and solve the idle state problem.
