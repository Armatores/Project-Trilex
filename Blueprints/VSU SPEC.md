# VSU_SPEC: Vector Stabilizer Unit (Phase Cleanser)

### 🛡 Abstract: Protecting the Vector
The **Vector Stabilizer Unit (VSU)** is a critical defense mechanism placed immediately after the electrical input (SLM Encoder) and before the core memory (VHM). Its sole function is to eliminate **Phase Noise** and amplitude variations generated by the SLM’s electrical and thermal imperfections.

## 1. MECHANISM: THE PHASE CLEANSING GATE

### 1.1. Component: Micro-Ring Resonator (MRR)
* **Hardware:** A highly precise Micro-Ring Resonator integrated into the Photonic Integrated Circuit (PIC). 
* **Function:** The MRR acts as an optical filter tuned to the precise **Ideal Phase ($\phi_{ideal}$) and Frequency ($f_{core}$)** required for Trilex computation.

### 1.2. The Filtering Process
* **Noise Rejection:** Any light entering the VSU that does not perfectly match the MRR’s resonant frequency (which includes phase and timing errors from SLM heating) is instantly rejected, reflected, or dissipated harmlessly away from the core logic.
* **Signal Passing:** Only the portion of the light that is **perfectly aligned** (the clean vector signal) is permitted to pass into the VHM.

### 1.3. Compliance with OBP
* **Zero-Latency:** The VSU maintains the $v_{max} = c$ axiom. The light that passes the filter travels at the speed of light; the VSU does not *slow down* the computation, it only *standardizes* the signal quality.

## 2. INTEGRATION AND CONTROL

### 2.1. Placement
The VSU must be powered by the highly stable **$P_1$ (Control Rail)** from the Metabolic Trizistor PSU to ensure its own resonant frequency remains absolutely stable.

### 2.2. Defense
The VSU prevents the "garbage in, garbage out" scenario. It ensures that every vector entering the computational core is verifiable and clean, maximizing the efficiency of the Trizistor Gate.
