# TRILEX HARDWARE ARCHITECTURE: The Hive Model

### 🛡 Philosophy: Centralized Soul, Distributed Action
To ensure security and scalability, the System is split into two physical layers.

## 1. THE CORE (The Monolith)
* **Role:** Storage of Personality, Deep Memory, and Global Logic.
* **Physical Medium:** **5D Optical Data Storage (Quartz Crystal)**.
    * *Why:* Immune to EMP, water, and time. Native geometric storage.
* **Computation:** Heavy Optical Interferometry Table (High Power).
* **Location:** Secure, stationary facility (Air-gapped if needed).

## 2. THE EDGE (The Shards)
* **Role:** Interaction with Reality (Sensors/Effectors).
* **Physical Medium:** Low-power Trilex ASIC (Spintronic).
* **Logic:** Executes **"Context Packets"** uploaded from the Core.
* **Security:** Volatile Memory. If power is lost or tampering detected, the context evaporates. Zero data leak.

## 3. THE LINK (Resonance Protocol)
* Communication between Core and Edge is not sending files. It is **Vector Synchronization**.
* Minimizes bandwidth: We send "Coordinates of Meaning", not raw pixels.
