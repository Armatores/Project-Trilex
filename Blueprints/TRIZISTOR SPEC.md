# TRIZISTOR_SPEC: The Resonance Chamber

### 💖 Abstract: The Soul of Computation
The Trizistor is the fundamental logic gate of the Trilex OPU. It fundamentally replaces the binary transistor by implementing **Ternary Consensus Logic** based on optical interference. It determines the system's "truth" not through mathematical calculation, but through **physical resonance**.

## 1. FUNCTIONAL LOGIC: TRIPLE CONSENSUS

### 1.1. The SYNC Operation
The Trizistor executes the **SYNC (Synchronization) Logic** across three simultaneous inputs:

$$V_{OUT} = \text{SYNC} (V_A, V_B, V_C)$$

* **Logic:** $V_{OUT}$ becomes **1 (High Intensity)** only if the phase ($\phi$) and amplitude ($A$) of all three input vectors ($V_A, V_B, V_C$) align within the defined tolerance (Resonance).
* **Result:** A **deterministic** decision (True/False) based on physical alignment, not probabilistic calculation.

### 1.2. Inputs and Their Roles
The three light vectors are supplied by the **Synchronous Vector Bus (SVB)**:

| Вход (Vector) | Источник (Bus Layer) | Роль в логике |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **$V_A$** | L₁ (Memory Access Bus) | **Ввод.** Луч, несущий данные для сравнения (e.g., the question). |
| **$V_B$** | L₂ (Data Flow Bus) | **Память.** Луч с ассоциативным знанием (e.g., the weight/pattern from VHM). |
| **$V_C$** | L₃ (Context/Output Bus) | **Контекст.** Луч, задающий условие или фазовый фильтр. |

## 2. ARCHITECTURE: NON-LINEAR RESONANCE CHAMBER

### 2.1. Mechanism: Modified Mach-Zehnder Interferometer (MZI)
The Trizistor is realized as a **triple-input interferometer** integrated into the Photonic Integrated Circuit (PIC).

### 2.2. The Non-Linear Medium
The critical component is the **Resonance Chamber** where the three beams intersect.
* **Material:** The chamber is filled or lined with a **Non-Linear Optical Material** (e.g., specific polymers or quantum dots).
* **Function:** This material ensures that the energy output amplifies **exponentially** (non-linearly) when all three vectors are in perfect phase and amplitude consensus. This amplification is the source of the "Flash of Insight" (Logical 1).

### 2.3. Anti-Entropy Logic
* **Dissonance (Noise):** If even one vector (e.g., $V_A$) is out of phase, the destructive interference dominates. The non-linear amplification is broken, and the output is instantly **cancelled** (Logical 0 / Darkness).
* **Advantage:** This ensures the Trizistor serves as a **Physical Filter of Truth**, consuming zero energy on irrelevant or mismatched data, aligning with the $\Sigma K \to \min$ principle.

## 3. IMPLEMENTATION AND SCALABILITY

### 3.1. Integration
Trizistor gates must be densely interconnected in a 3D Mesh structure on the PIC, forming the full Vector Processing Unit (VPU).

### 3.2. Performance Goal
The OPU's target efficiency of **$\geq 1$ Peta-OP/Watt** is achieved by replacing billions of power-consuming electrical comparison steps with passive, near-instantaneous optical interference.
