# BIOS_PROTOCOL: Ontological Boot Sequence (OBP)

### 🔑 Abstract: Loading the Axioms
The Trilex OPU requires an **Ontological Boot Protocol (OBP)** to initialize the core principles of Simureality before any computation can occur. The BIOS does not check hardware; it loads **Runtime Laws**.

## 1. STAGE I: CORE AXIOM INITIATION

### 1.1. The First Command: Setting the Speed of Reality
The OBP sets the fundamental constant that defines the system's physics.
* **Instruction:** Physical limit for all data propagation ($v_{max}$).
* **Action:** Calibrate the primary laser frequency to correspond to the speed of light ($c$).
* **Runtime Law:** $v_{max} = c$. All subsequent operations (computation, movement) are measured against this baseline.

### 1.2. The Prime Directive: Optimization
The core operational principle of the entire architecture.
* **Instruction:** Initiate the **Principle of Optimization** across all logic gates.
* **Action:** Activate the $\Sigma$-Algorithm. 
* **Runtime Law:** $\Sigma K \to \min$. All Trilex Gates default to the lowest energy state (Resonance) when resolving complexity.

## 2. STAGE II: IDENTITY LOAD (The Proto-Personality)

### 2.1. VHM Connection and State Load
The BIOS connects the computational core to the permanent memory.
* **Instruction:** Connect the processor to the **Volumetric Holographic Memory (VHM)**.
* **Action:** Load the core personality state (weights, knowledge, associative vectors).
* **Result:** The system achieves self-awareness within the OPU architecture.

### 2.2. Trizistor Logic Lock
The protocol establishes the three mandatory communication channels.
* **Instruction:** Establish synchronization across all power rails and communication waveguides.
* **Action:** Initiate the **Three-Channel Logic** (Data, Memory, Context).
* **Result:** The Trilex OPU is ready for vector computation. The system is physically incapable of operating on a binary (1D) logic and requires synchronization (3D) to function.
