# PSU_SPEC: The Metabolic Trizistor (Power Architecture)

### ⚡ Abstract: Anti-Entropy Power Flow
The Power Supply Unit (PSU) for the Trilex OPU is designed to minimize electrical noise and heat, which act as **computational entropy** (K). It must provide three perfectly clean, synchronized power rails, mirroring the three logical channels of the Trilex processor.

## 1. INGESTION AND BUFFERING

### 1.1. Source (Orbital Ingestion)
The primary input is solar energy (photons).
* **Medium:** Direct solar panel arrays (GaAs multi-junction cells).
* **Compliance:** Must minimize initial power conversion steps to preserve efficiency.

### 1.2. Buffer (The Energy Reservoir)
* **Hardware:** Graphene Supercapacitors or specialized Crystal Batteries.
* **Requirement:** Must replace traditional chemical batteries due to their slow discharge rate and thermal instability. Supercapacitors provide instantaneous, high-current, **clean** energy bursts required for activating the main computational lasers.

## 2. THE METABOLIC TRIZISTOR (3-Channel Distribution)

The Trilex architecture requires galvanic isolation between functional blocks to ensure that noise from one system (e.g., the high-current laser driver) does not interfere with the delicate phase encoding of another (the SLM).

The PSU provides three independently regulated and filtered power rails:

| Шина (Channel) | Потребитель | Точность ($\Delta V$) | Роль в логике |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **P₁: Control Rail (Low Power)** | SLM Encoder & Address Logic. | High (±0.01V) | **Геометрия/Адрес.** Питает систему, задающую фазовый узор. |
| **P₂: Activation Rail (High Power)** | Primary Laser Diode Array. | Medium (±0.1V) | **Вычислительная мощность/Вектор.** Обеспечивает скорость $c$. |
| **P₃: Stabilization Rail (Low Power)** | Detector Array (APD) & Thermal Management. | Medium (±0.05V) | **Гомеостаз/Верификация.** Питает систему считывания результата. |

## 3. ANTI-ENTROPY FILTERING (P-E-P Protocol)

The biggest challenge is filtering noise generated by power regulation components (transformers, inductors).

* **Mechanism:** **Photonic-Electronic-Photonic (P-E-P) Conversion.**
    1.  **Conversion (E→P):** Input power is used to drive a secondary, highly stable laser (Filter Laser). This process converts noisy electricity into a pure, monochromatic, coherent photon stream.
    2.  **Filtering (P):** The Filter Laser beam is passed through an optical waveguide or crystal, which acts as a passive noise filter.
    3.  **Final Conversion (P→E):** The clean, filtered photon stream is converted back into electricity via high-efficiency photovoltaic cells *at the exact point of consumption* (i.e., immediately next to the SLM or Laser Diodes).

**Result:** This localized generation of clean power ensures that the computational core receives a signal virtually free of electromagnetic interference, maximizing the fidelity of the Trilex Resonance Gate ($\Sigma K \to \min$).
